# Data Extraction: 
Data is extracted from the SQL database using SQL queries. 
This allows you to select only the data that is needed for analysis and model training.

# Data Transformation: 
After extraction, the data can be transformed into a more convenient format for processing, such as CSV, Parquet, or JSON. 
This is done to facilitate further processing and analysis. For example, CSV is a universal format supported by most data analysis and machine learning tools.
