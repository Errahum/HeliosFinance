# Why AGPL-3.0?

## Sharing and Collaboration
We chose the AGPL-3.0 license to ensure that this project remains free and accessible to the community. This license promotes transparency and collaboration by requiring that any modifications to the source code, when used to provide a service over a network (such as a web application), be made available to the public. This allows other developers to contribute, improve, and share their own modifications.

## Responsibility and Ethics
The AGPL-3.0 reflects our commitment to open-source principles and the responsibility to ensure that improvements to the project benefit everyone. By using this license, we ensure that users of the software, even when accessed remotely, have access to the source code and can understand, modify, and enhance the software.

## Encouraging Innovation
By fostering an environment where code is shared and contributions are encouraged, we hope to stimulate innovation and ongoing improvement of the project. We believe that AGPL-3.0 helps create a more open and collaborative development ecosystem.

We encourage you to review the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license and contribute to the project while adhering to these principles.
